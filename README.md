# Discourse and Sentiment Mapping in Social Media Analytics

This repo contains a BCom Honours business analytics project focused on analyzing social media discourse using advanced NLP. We applied dual-method sentiment analysis and topic modeling to 10,000 anonymized tweets (Jan–Apr 2023) to uncover thematic clusters, emotional tone, and discourse structure.

## Project Overview
- **Objective:** Extract and interpret dominant themes, sentiment trends, and discursive dynamics from large-scale social media data.
- **Dataset:** 10,000 anonymized Twitter posts (Jan–Apr 2023), NDA-protected, ethically managed.
- **Methods:** Sentiment analysis (VADER, TextBlob, ensemble), topic modeling (LDA, BERTopic), network knowledge mapping (NetworkX).

## Methodology
- Data cleaning, metadata review, ethics compliance.
- Sentiment scoring using dual models and ensemble approach.
- Topic modeling with coherence optimization, manual topic labeling.
- Discourse mapping via network graphs and sentiment flows.

## Key Results
- 15 distinct topics identified; overall positive discourse (79.2% positive sentiment).
- Scientific Discovery/Health most contentious; Personal Life topics most consistent.
- Sentiment evenly distributed (Chi-square p = 0.052).
- Discourse network reveals both polarization zones and consensus areas.
- Business insights for brand monitoring, crisis management, and content strategy.

## Technical Stack
- Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, TextBlob, VADER, NLTK, gensim, BERTopic, pyLDAvis, NetworkX
